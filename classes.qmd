# Classes

All the data structures discussed are also known as an object's class. While R
has many predefined classes, it is flexible to create new classes. Many packages
define their own classes of objects. This can be beneficial for organizational
purposes as well as to build custom functions for specialized analysis.

This is a high level concept to be aware of. Bioconductor for example has many
specialized classes related to genomic research. An overview of some of those
classes can be found at [Introduction to Bioconductor
Classes](https://lshep.github.io/RPG520/articles/day_4.html).

If time permits we'll come back to showing how custom and more complex classes,
while intimidating to learn at first, can be really beneficial and help prevent careless errors if designed correctly.
