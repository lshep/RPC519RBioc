### Random

Bold: `**`

Italics: `*`

Line Space: `---`

Inline Code: Single Backticks ```` ` ```` Inline Code ```` ` ````

Note: If using html as output than can use html syntax as well (e.g `<br>`, `<a
href = https:///>tag</a>` 

### Code Blocks

Code Block: Backticks  to open and close section:  ```` ``` ````

Code Block Options: After opening backticks `{}` can define options for the code
chunk. It is always a good idea to give it the programming language and an id
for the code chunk for debugging `{r myid, options ...}`
Common Options:

- eval
- echo
- results
- message
- warning
- figure options: fig.cap, out.width, etc

### Tables

- library(knitr) for kable
- library(kableExtra) for cool styling and built in themes
- library(DT) for interactive tables

### Lists

Ordered uses numbers

Unordered uses Dash `-`

Checklist use Dash space brackets `- [ ]` or `- [X]` 

### Figures

- Build it with `![image caption](path to image)`
- library(knitr) include_graphics
- html `<figure>`

### Table of Contents

- In rmarkdown header
```
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true

```
- Special: `[Back to top](#top)`
- You can anchor any section header `# Coding Section{#codechunk}` and then
reference `[link to coding](#codechunk)`
- With html `<a href="#top" style="color:red; float:right;">Back to top</a>`


### Plotting

- Code blocks have options for plotting

- Can include directly in code block or save to png, jpeg, etc and include
  elsewhere

- library(knitr) include_graphics


### Tabulars

```

## Results {.tabset}

### Text
Some Overview Text

### Plots
Anoter section

### tables

```


### Columns

- Can specify for the entire document through options and layouts but ad hoc
  with columns

```

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
something

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Second column

:::
